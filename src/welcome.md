# Welcome to the CU Sounding Rocket Lab's Documentation

This is the landing page for most of our documentation.

If you are not yet a member of the CU SRL, please visit our site, at [https://soundingrocketlab.com/](https://soundingrocketlab.com/), for more information on getting involved. 

## Editing the docs

Click on the little Github icon on the top right of this page, or go to the repo at [https://github.com/CU-SRL/docs](https://github.com/CU-SRL/docs). 

If you're interested in doing heavy editing, we recommend you install `git` and work on the pages using a Markdown editor such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

1. Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:CU-SRL/docs.git` (Mac and Linux), or [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) on Windows.
2. Open the `src/` folder in an editor of your choice.
3. To create a new document, create a new file ending in `.md`, and enter its path into [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md). To create a section header or subheader, use the Markdown header syntax (`#` for primary, `##` for secondary).
4. To finalize your changes, run `git add .`, then `git commit -m "<change description>"`, followed by `git push origin main`.
