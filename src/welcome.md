# Welcome to the CU Sounding Rocket Lab's Documentation

This is the landing page for most of our documentation.

If you are not yet a member of the CU SRL, please visit our site, at [https://soundingrocketlab.com/](https://soundingrocketlab.com/), for more information on getting involved. 

## Editing the docs

Click on the little Github icon on the top right of this page, or go to [https://github.com/UCBoulder/cusrl.github.io](https://github.com/UCBoulder/cusrl.github.io). 

### Editing Pages

For editing a page, all you'll need is your IdentiKey. Click on the "Suggest an edit" button on the top right, that looks like a pen on paper. This will take you to the Github edit page, where you can make your changes.

Be sure to commit your changes (the green button at the bottom) after your edits. 

### Adding Pages

You can add pages on the GitHub repository itself, or clone the repository and add Markdown files yourself. More information to come here later.
