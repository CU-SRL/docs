# List of Past Projects
Here you can see the past iteration of the avionics software framework that had been in development over the past few years.

- [SRL_COSMOS](cosmos.md)

Over the 2022 summer, the software team came to the decision to pursue an alternative path for software development, that being switching which framework we use. The reason we've diverged from using cFS is fairly lengthy, but can be summed up like this: F' is much more lightweight and suited for our intended purposes, unlike cFS which had many aspects that we were nowhere close to using in terms of our laid out timeline. This made cFS not only difficult to program for, but even led to hardware troubles since our micrcontroller didn't have enough processing power to properly run it. If you have any questions about that decision, or just want to know more about it, feel free to reach out to @Winnie Regan on slack.

Note: On the CUSRL github, that are even older versions of the avionics system that were used in the past, such as the CUSRL_Avionics repo, that you're welcome to browse if interested.
