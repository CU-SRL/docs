# COSMOS Ground Station

COSMOS is a ground station developed by Ball Aerospace, that the software team had taylored to to be the receiving end of telemetry from the flight computer. Apps were developed on this platform that specfically correlated to apps created on cFS, and allowed for specific customization of the ground station.

[SRL_COSMOS Repo](https://github.com/CU-SRL/SRL_COSMOS) is where you can find the code developed by while this was still used. If you would like to learn more about this project, reach out to the current software lead, Jason Popich, or Zoe Roy.

This ground station may still me used on the future for the purposes of RF communication, however the team will currently make use of the web-based ground station that comes with F'. For the sake of ease and faster development, the use of COSMOS is going on hold until we reach a point where it can be efficiently incorporated into our development plan.
