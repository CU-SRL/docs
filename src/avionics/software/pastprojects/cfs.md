# Core Flight System (cFS)

The cFS system was a collection of sensor applications built off of NASA's cFS to read and write to/from sensors. It failed to run properly on the BeagleBone Black board due to a suspected scheduler degredation surrounding the linux install.

[SRL cFS Repo](https://github.com/CU-SRL/SRL_cFS) contains all code developed while cFS was our primary platform. For more information reach out to the current software lead, Jason Popich, or Zoe Roy.
