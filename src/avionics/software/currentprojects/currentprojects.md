# List of Current Projects
Here you can see the different directions we will be taking over the course of the semester!

## In Progress
- [Sensor Apps](sensorapps.md) - See this [list](../../hardware/currentprojects/testingboard/testingboard.md) for all of the sensors we are writing apps for. See the github projects page for the progress on all the individual apps.
- [GPS Testing](gpstesting.md) - We are at the point where we need to see the behavior of our current startup command. This will give us a good idea of where the problem is, as right now it appears that the serialReceiver isn't being properly called.
- Fix autocoders (see dev notes for more info)
    - Impl file names
    - Groundstation version fallback

## Completed
- [BBB Toolchain](bbbtoolchain.md)
