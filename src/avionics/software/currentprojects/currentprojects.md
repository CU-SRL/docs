# List of Current Projects
Here you can see the different directions we will be taking over the course of the semester!

## In Progress
- [RF Downlink]() - It is important that we get live data from the rocket streamed to the ground in-flight. Further documentation at the link.
- [Sensor Suite]() - The sensor suite has been mostly completed by the team in years past. Our job this year is to diagnose and fix any of the lingering issues to increase the robustness of the board.
- [Recovery]() - The goal of the flight computer is to be able to control the entire rocket, which includes recovery. This year we will be adding pyro channels to the board to fulfill this requirement.





<!--
- [Sensor Apps](sensorapps.md) - See this [list](../../hardware/currentprojects/testingboard/testingboard.md) for all of the sensors we are writing apps for. See the github projects page for the progress on all the individual apps.
- [GPS Testing](gpstesting.md) - We are at the point where we need to see the behavior of our current startup command. This will give us a good idea of where the problem is, as right now it appears that the serialReceiver isn't being properly called.
- Fix autocoders (see dev notes for more info)
    - Impl file names
    - Groundstation version fallback
