# Sensor Apps in Development

Currently we have soldered two components onto breadboards for the sake of easy testing via jumper wires hooked up to a rasberry pi.
We also have a set of sensors that will be used in the future, these are what the assignments will mostly comprise of.

## Project Assignments

Talk about issues, how we will assign sensors, etc.

## Datasheets
