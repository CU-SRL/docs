# Sensor Apps in Development

Currently we have soldered two components onto breadboards for the sake of easy testing via jumper wires hooked up to a rasberry pi. These sensors are the MPL3115A2 and the MCP9808, whose datasheets are listed below.

The topology will consist of a single deployment with all sensor apps containted within the deployment.

## Project Assignments

The assignment process will entail the creation of a GitHub issue that will be assigned to an individual/group of individuals. They will then create a branch from the development that will contain all the code needed. Upon completion of the work a pr will be opened and meeting with software lead to review code.
