# Testing Documentation

NOTE, THIS PAGE IS STILL UNDER HEAVY DISCUSSION AND UPDATES WILL BE COMING SOON, WE WANT TO BE VERY DETAILED ABOUT THIS

This page is to develop a test plan so that we make the most out of each launch. SRL is not rich and we should do our due diligence to make sure we don't waste each opportunity we get to launch!

## List of Tests To Perform For 

- ESD Tests (want to start off by shocking a board that only has 1 cheap component soldered onto it (hopefully the most sensitive device to voltage), no need to shock a fully populated board)
- Accelerometer Drift (as we integrate to get our position)
- GPS functionality
- Pressure readings
- Data logging capabilities
- Chute deployment tests
- Physical shock/vibration
