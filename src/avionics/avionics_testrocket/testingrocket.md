## Documentation on Avionics Testing Rocket

We will document our design process from an avionics perspective on these pages!

Our intention is to fly an L1 or L2 cert rocket with our current board in conjunction with the planned L1 launches for the club. This will allow us to have an early, lower-stakes test flight than on Mamba III.

More to come soon.
