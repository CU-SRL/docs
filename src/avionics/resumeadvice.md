## This is a page for avionics members to list out resume and career tips!

First off, feel free to reach out to your avionics lead if you want to meet 1-on-1 for resume advice or simply send them/him/her your current resume. Whatever your comfortable with! Your sub-team leads and team lead will always be willing to help you out, and Andrew Lee (the person writing this, avionics lead of 2022) can vouch for how much meaning you can gain for getting feedback from peers on your resume. This will be a page that gets updated as time moves forward, and hopefully it can be a great additional resource for your professional development!
