# Testing Board

The Testing Board project is a platform we design and test software and hardware on. It involves designing a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB), writing software to work on sensors embedded on that PCB, and testing the system.

It is designed primarily as a proof-of-concept demo platform, and will not be implemented on the final rocket. That said, practices and designs implemented on the Testing Board will likely see usage on the final product.
