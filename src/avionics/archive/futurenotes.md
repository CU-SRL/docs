# New Member On-Boarding Process Documentation

Documenting the on-boarding processes have been used in the past, noting what has gone right and what should be changed.


\[PAST YEARS\]
For hardware, this year we will begin with a soldering workshop using cheap solderable breadboards, basic LEDs, resistors, and anything else the team needs to be soldered right now. The goal of the workshop is to get new members excited about creating something, introduce electronics concepts to people who have no experience, give them a framework for how they can imagine the design that they will be doing in Altium Designer.

The workshop will cover the topics of through-hole soldering, surface mount soldering, multimeter usage, circuit basics if there are new members not familiar with those concepts, explanation of what parts look like, what the parts do, what an IC is, maybe some wire stripping, splicing, etc.

Then Andrew Lee is planning on giving an introduction to Altium Designer lecture. The workshop happened on a friday evening, he will probably go over stuff on the following avionics full team on Sunday and let people get a list of things to get set up with Altium Designer on Saturday (or maybe do this on Friday if we end earlier than expected). He will record this video this time around, be in-person to help out.

Then after assessing the amount of new members, we will cater our projects to match that. If there are a lot, we may begin with development of break-out boards just to help build basic experience, or kick-off a new sensor board project with GPS module which will be seperate from the testing board. Update the documentation after the first avionics meeting with new members to develop that plan.

NOTE: There were 17 people who showed up out of the 29 that joined the slack channel. 7 out of 17ish people joined from talking at classes. In new member meeting during breakout, 3 new members went to hardware, 6 to software, 8 to RF

There were also 3 more people that joined later. 

Sub-team leads are doing new member on-boarding meetings this week (hardware on friday and software on saturday night). The attendance to each was:

- 5 new members showed up to the hardware meeting
- 10-ish new members showed up to the software meeting
