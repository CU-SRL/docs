# Getting Involved!

Ready to get involved? Follow these steps!

Do everything on the [new member checklist](https://soundingrocketlab.com/srl-new-member-checklist/).

You can find an updated list of all the current members on the [central page](centralpage.md). Reach out to the current avionics team lead. Send them a nice message with the following (not actually required but for fun and letting the team lead get to know you!): 

- year
- major
- what you like to do for fun
- why you're interested in avionics (can be: I don't know anything about avionics and want to learn more!)
- your favorite home-cooked meal (the current avionics lead needs inspiration for what to cook, recently been struggling)

Reach out to the sub-team lead with the topic you're most interested in (electronics hardware, software, RF-specific engineering). You can find who the sub-team leads are on the [central page](centralpage.md). Send them the same message you sent the team lead. 

On the slack, join the `#avionics` channel, `#avionics-hardware`, `#avionics-software`, and `#sparks-and-rec` channels.

The sub-team lead should have a list of things you need to do to get set up with the team, ask about this! Also let them know how much experience you are coming in with so they can cater the onboarding process to you individually.

Jot down the time and date of the next avionics meeting in your planner! (Also should be on the [central Page](centralpage.md))
