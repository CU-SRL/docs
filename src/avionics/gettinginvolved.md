Ready to get involved? Follow these steps!


Do everything in this [New Member Checklist](https://soundingrocketlab.com/srl-new-member-checklist/).

You can find an updated list of all the current members on the [Central Page](centralpage.md). Reach out to the current avionics team lead. Send them a nice message with the following (not actually required but for fun and letting the team lead get to know you!): 

-year

-major

-what you like to do for fun

-why you're interested in avionics

-your favorite home-cooked meal (the current avionics lead needs inspiration for what to cook, recently been struggling)


Reach out to the sub-team lead with the topic you're most interested in (electronics hardware, software, RF-specific engineering). Send them the same message you sent the team lead :). The sum-team lead should have a list of things you need to do to get set-up with the team, ask about this! Also let them know how much experience you are coming in with so they can cater the on-boarding process to you individually.

Jot down the time and date of the next avionics meeting in your planner! (Also should be on the [Central Page](centralpage.md))
