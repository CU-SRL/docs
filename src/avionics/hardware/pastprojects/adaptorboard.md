# Adaptor Board

The purpose of this project was to develop and test a sensor system on the Obsidian rocket flight. The adaptor board was meant to be one that connected the main microcontroller (Beaglebone Black) to the rest of the stack, but was re-purposed when the team decided to push to launch Obsidian.
