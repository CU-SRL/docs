# Development Resources

Here is a list of useful resources that the EE team has used in the past to aid in their development. They are organized by topic.

## Altium Designer Guides
- [Eric Bogatin's Online Altium Course](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/practicalpcbdesignmanufacture/erics-altium-workshop)

This guide is the one that Andrew Lee vouches for. This is how he began his journey learning about electronics design. Eric Bogatin is a professor at CU who is incredibly knowledgeable and famous for his publishings on signal integrity and high speed digital design among many other topics. Altium Designer has had him as a keynote speaker at several of their AltiumLive events. With diligent work, this course will probably take around 2 weeks to complete (or beat Andrew and do it faster, I bet you won't). 


## Altium Education Student License
- [Link For Student License](https://www.altium.com/education/student-licenses)

Altium is a VERY expensive software for companies to use. Luckily, we get to use this industry standard ECAD tool as students for free.
