# New Member On-Boarding Process Documentation

This is a journal for avionics team lead and hardware sub-team lead to document the on-boarding processes they have used in the past, noting what has gone right and what should be changed.

This year we will begin with a soldering workshop using cheap solderable breadboards, basic LEDs, resistors, and anything else the team needs to be soldered right now. The goal of the workshop is to get new members excited about creating something, introduce electronics concepts to people who have no experience, give them a framework for how they can imagine the design that they will be doing in Altium Designer.

Then Andrew Lee is planning on giving an introduction to Altium Designer lecture. He will record this video this time around, be in-person to help out.

Then after assessing the amount of new members, we will cater our projects to match that. If there are a lot, we may begin with development of break-out boards just to help build basic experience, or kick-off a new sensor board project with GPS module which will be seperate from the testing board. Update the documentation after the first avionics meeting with new members to develop that plan.

NOTE: 7 out of 17ish people joined from talking at classes. In new member meeting during breakout, 3 new members went to hardware, 6 to software, 8 to RF
