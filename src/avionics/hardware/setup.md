# New Member Set-Up Guide

This is a page dedicated to making it easier for hardware new members to get set-up. This page provides excellent resources to learning the basics of the software tools we use, how to get access to those tools, etc. 

Here is a list of software that we use regularly:
- Altium Designer
- LTSpice
- Saleae Logic 2

Note that Altium Designer and Saleae Logic 2 must operate on windows. For other OS's, talk to the team lead and they can help work out the details of how you can get involved with hardware.

## Getting set up with Altium

Follow the link to go to Altium's [Link For Student License](https://www.altium.com/education/student-licenses). Because we are students, we are able to use Altium Designer for free, which is huge because Altium Designer is a REALLY expensive software to use for companies. This link should make it self-explanatory but if you are having trouble, reach out to the hardware sub-team lead.

## Getting LTSpice

Follow the link to go to [LTSpice Download Link](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html). This is a useful circuit simulation software. No one in industry will almost ever touch a differential equation because there are so many circuit simulation software things out there. This one is a really good basic circuit simulation software.

## Getting Saleae Logic 2

So an old avionics member named Brendan happened to have like 10 of these cheap knock-off logic analyzers. He donated them all to the avionics team, and we will begin handing these out to people as soon as they are needed when we actually start testing. They work with [Saleae Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/) software, which is nice beacuse the software will automatically talk interpret the one's and zero's on a signal line as long as it's not a proprietary communication method. This is really useful to debugging circuits, testing software, and bringing up our boards.

## Some cool resources and guides:

- [Eric Bogatin's Altium Workshop](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/practicalpcbdesignmanufacture/erics-altium-workshop)
- [LTSpice Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRcyHuyb1V0&t=581s&ab_channel=FesZElectronics)
- [Saleae User's Guide](http://downloads.saleae.com/Saleae+Users+Guide.pdf)

These are all resources that past hardware leads have used to learn more about the tools in this page. They are all confirmed to be really really interesting. All of the tools we use have excellent documentation and finding more resources or guides on them is really easy (just search it up on google). Feel free to ask questions in the avionics hardware channel for any confusion on these topics, we are all here to help!
